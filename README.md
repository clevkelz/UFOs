# UFOs
## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to create a searchable table using JavaScript to filter information regarding UFO sightings.  The sightings data included the date of the sighting, the location (city, state, and country), the shape of the object, the duration of the event, and related comments.  Code was written in JavaScript to compile the information, create filters, and save the results.  HTML code was also created so that users could filter the data on five variables (the date, city, state, country, and object shape) and display the results in a table.

## Results

The web page is prefaced with a heading and text.  This piece serves as an introduction to the filterable table.

Before filtering, the searchable fields display default values and the entire data set is displayed in the table.

The user will type in values in the fields and the results will appear in the table to the right after hitting the enter key.  For example, if an user wishes to find sightings in California on New Years’ Day in 2010 with a triangle shape, the following steps would be made.
1.	Type “ca” in the state field and hit enter.
2.	Type “1/1/2010” in the date field and hit enter.
3.	Type “triangle” in the shape field and hit enter. 

The results will display after each step is taken.

## Summary

Although the website is off to a good start, there are some limitations and further development would improve the quality of the the page.

### Drawback

Although the data can be filtered, it is much more difficult to obtain results without knowing the universe of data that can be queried.  For example, the list of cities with results is not known unless the user scrolls through all the data.  A drop down box would make the tool more useful.

### Recommendations for Future Development
-	Expand the time frame in which to draw results.  If the purpose of the page is to demonstrate whether UFOs exist, having a short time can limit the results.
-	Incorporate results from other areas of the world.  All of the results are from the United States.  Although it could make data formatting more challenging if results are captured in different formats, having a more global view can strengthen the quality of the information.
